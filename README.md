# Phishing Detection Using Hybrid Ensemble Model

## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting phishing URLs using a **hybrid ensemble model** that combines multiple machine learning algorithms to build a system that can identify phishing URLs based on features extracted from the URL structure, content, and other characteristics.

## Technologies Used

### Programming Languages:
- Python
- PHP

### Hybrid Ensemble Machine Learning Algorithms:
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- Decision Tree (DT)

### Libraries:
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- joblib
- requests
- Flask (for deployment)

## Features

- **Phishing URL Detection:** Detects phishing URLs using an ensemble approach.
- **Data Validation:** Includes data validation scripts to ensure input data is in the correct format.
- **Feature Extraction:** Extracts relevant features from URLs.
- **Model Training:** Includes scripts to train the model.
- **Web Interface:** Simple web interface using PHP and Flask.
