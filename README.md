#Phishing Detection Using Hybrid Ensemble Model

## Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting phishing websites using a **hybrid ensemble model** that combines multiple machine learning algorithms. 
The goal is to build a system that can identify phishing URLs based on features extracted from the URL structure, content, and other characteristics.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages:**
  - Python
  - PHP

- **Machine Learning Algorithms:**
  - Logistic Regression
  - Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
  - Decision Tree (DT)

- **Libraries:**
  - scikit-learn
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - joblib
  - requests
  - Flask (for deployment)

## Features

- **Phishing URL Detection:** Detects phishing URLs using an ensemble approach.
- **Data Validation:** Includes data validation scripts to ensure input data is in the correct format.
- **Feature Extraction:** Extracts relevant features from URLs to use as input for machine learning models.
- **Model Training:** Includes scripts to train the model using different machine learning techniques.
- **Web Interface:** A simple web interface using PHP and Flask for deployment.
